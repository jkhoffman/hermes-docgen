# Hermes – Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Hermes is an AI-powered command-line tool designed to automatically generate high-quality Markdown documentation for TypeScript projects. Built with modern AI capabilities, Hermes acts as a "virtual documentation writer" for your codebase.

- **Purpose**: Eliminate documentation tedium by using AI to understand code semantics and generate human-readable docs, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- **Target Users**: TypeScript developers who want comprehensive documentation without excessive time investment.

## User Personas

### Alex Chen - Senior Frontend Developer at a Mid-size SaaS Company

**Background:**
- 8 years of TypeScript experience
- Works on a team of 12 developers with shared codebase ownership
- Regular contributor to open-source UI libraries

**Pain Points:**
- Documentation constantly falls behind during sprint cycles
- New team members struggle to understand component architecture without proper docs
- Spends 15-20% of time writing and updating documentation

**Goals:**
- Reduce time spent on documentation while improving quality
- Standardize documentation format across the team
- Generate docs that include visual component hierarchies

**Usage Pattern:**
Alex would integrate Hermes into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate documentation when code is merged. They would use the GitHub Action integration for PR previews and configure high detail levels for API documentation with component visualization.

### Morgan Taylor - Solo Developer Building a TypeScript SDK

**Background:**
- 4 years of TypeScript experience
- Building and maintaining an open-source SDK
- Focused on developer adoption of their library

**Pain Points:**
- As a solo developer, documentation is often deprioritized
- Users frequently request better examples and use cases
- Struggles to write beginner-friendly tutorials while maintaining comprehensive API docs

**Goals:**
- Create professional documentation that enhances credibility
- Increase adoption through clear, comprehensive guides
- Balance time between coding and documentation

**Usage Pattern:**
Morgan would run Hermes locally during development cycles, focusing on the Diátaxis framework to create both tutorials and reference material. They would emphasize example generation and use Docsify for hosting on GitHub Pages.

### Jamie Rodriguez - Lead Developer at an Enterprise Company

**Background:**
- 12+ years of programming experience, 5 with TypeScript
- Manages a large-scale application with strict security requirements
- Responsible for onboarding new team members

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot share code with external services due to compliance requirements
- Documentation is scattered across wikis, code comments, and Confluence
- Knowledge silos form when senior developers leave

**Goals:**
- Centralize documentation in a secure, searchable system
- Ensure architectural decisions are well-documented
- Reduce onboarding time for new team members

**Usage Pattern:**
Jamie would use Hermes in local-only mode with privacy controls to ensure sensitive code isn't shared externally. They would focus on explanation and architectural documentation with MermaidJS diagrams to visualize system components.

### Riley Johnson - TypeScript Developer at a Fast-Growing Startup

**Background:**
- 3 years of TypeScript experience
- Works in a fast-paced environment with frequent pivots
- Responsible for both frontend and backend TypeScript code

**Pain Points:**
- Documentation quickly becomes outdated during rapid development
- Lacks time to write comprehensive docs during feature sprints
- Struggles to document complex type relationships

**Goals:**
- Keep documentation in sync with rapidly changing codebase
- Minimize documentation effort while maximizing usefulness
- Ensure API types are well-documented for team consumption

**Usage Pattern:**
Riley would run Hermes on a scheduled basis to detect and update outdated documentation. They would use the incremental update feature to focus on changed files and configure GitHub integration for documentation checks on PRs.
